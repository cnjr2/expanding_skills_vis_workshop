28509,Nøgne Ø India Pale Ale,Nøgne Ø,10,5,8,5,18,4.6,"Cloudy orange, medium head. Enormous lovely hop aroma of citrus and flowers. Deep, powerful initial taste, followed by heavy bitterness that lingers. Fantastic! A beer to savour, and IMHO the best Norwegian beer currently available.",2/11/2005 7:33:23 AM,Norway,Grimstad,India Pale Ale (IPA),0.6,0.6,0.8,0,0.6,60.472024,8.468946
41915,Nøgne Ø # 100 (Batch 100),Nøgne Ø,8,5,7,5,17,4.2,"(500 ml bottle, purchased in a pub after the owner learned I was interested in beer. Had it twice.)  Cloudy, dark orange, substantial head. Oily mouthfeel. Less aroma and taste than the Nøgne Ø IPA. Powerful, heavy taste, with substantial bitterness. The 80 IBU are quite well hidden, and overall I'm somewhat disappointed. I had enormous expectations for this beer after the Nøgne Ø IPA, so even if I was disappointed this remains a very good beer.",2/11/2005 7:28:14 AM,Norway,Grimstad,Barley Wine,0.7,0.8,0.8,0,0.6,60.472024,8.468946
