# expanding_skills_vis_workshop
Data visualisation is one of the pillars of data analysis. Broadly it fulfils two roles: (1) to help gain insights into your data with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and (2) to communicate these insights to a wider audience. In this workshop we will be looking at how to quickly explore, describe and summarize large amounts of data and how to communicate it effectively with visual representations. We will work hands-on through a dataset, learning the basics of data reshaping with "Pandas" and we will explore a popular interactive graphing library: Plotly. Donâ€™t worry if you have never done EDA before, this workshop will be a step-by-step guide and you will leave with code snippets that you can apply to your own data.
