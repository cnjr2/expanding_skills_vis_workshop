We will be using Exploratory Data Analysis ([EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)) which heavily relies on producing **summary statistics** from the data along with **visual representation**. We use [`plotly`](https://plot.ly/) as our visualisation tool and [`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org/) to quickly manipulate data. Together they form a great toolkit to build interacive graphs step-by-step.\n",
